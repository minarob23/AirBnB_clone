# Description
Project is done by  [**Mina Robir**](https://github.com/minarob23)

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

# Requirements
# Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
 
## Installation
* Clone this repository: git clone "https://github.com/alexaorrico/AirBnB_clone.git"
* Access AirBnb directory: cd AirBnB_clone
* Run hbnb(interactively): ./console and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): echo "<command>" | ./console.py

# More Info
# Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode:`$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`
